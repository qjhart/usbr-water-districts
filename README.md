USBR defined Federal Water Districts
13th Edition  Published August 31, 2010.  

## ABSTRACT

Federal Water Contract boundaries are incorporated boundaries of
districts having contracts with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation). These data are updated when sufficient number of
changes have occured to warrant an update. Updates are determined by
the needs of the local office and are composited from separate
databases. Boundaries are updated as changes are identified by the
Water Districts. The boundaries are not current for all Water
Districts found in the database at the same time due to the update
methods employed. There may be conflicts in the boundaries between
districts due to the time of update, the review process associated,
and issues between each Water District. Other problems may be
associated with Water District name changes that may not have been
updated by the Water District. The Klamath area water districts were
digitized under a contract that the Klamath area office held with UC
Davis in 1990. MPGIS received those districts from the Klamath Area
Office GIS center. This database represents the most current and
accurate understanding of the boundary location and current name of
the Water Districts.

## PURPOSE

The Federal Water Contract boundaries database is cooperatively shared
between the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Mid-Pacific
regional office (MP), MPGIS Service Center and the California
Department of Water Resources (DWR). The Reclamation maintains this
database with the voluntary assistance of the Federal Water
Contractors. This database is used by Reclamation for various purposes
including, but not limited to, contracting, operational, and
maintenance purposes. This database is not intended to be used as a
land survey or representation of land for conveyance or tax
purposes. The database is available to all users that may require this
information.

## Process 

The USBR provides maps at 1:24,000-scale to the various Water
Districts for review. Boundary corrections are marked on the map
provided or on other source material by knowledgeable staff in the
Water District. Boundary corrections are delineated at maximum of
1:24,000-scale using USGS topological maps for reference. Data
provided at better resolution are maintained at the scale
provided. Boundary changes are digitized using a Calcomp 9000
digitizer and Arc/Info or ArcMap. Some boundary changes were input
using COGO. Not all Water Districts responded to the USBR MP request
for review.
